  abstract = { Typical fluid particle trajectories are sensitive to changes in their initial conditions. This makes the assessment of flow models and observations from individual tracer samples unreliable. Behind complex and sensitive tracer patterns, however, there exists a robust skeleton of material surfaces, Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), shaping those patterns. Free from the uncertainties of single trajectories, LCSs frame, quantify, and even forecast key aspects of material transport. Several diagnostic quantities have been proposed to visualize LCSs. More recent mathematical approaches identify LCSs precisely through their impact on fluid deformation. This review focuses on the latter developments, illustrating their applications to geophysical fluid dynamics. }

  abstract = {{This paper presents new efficient methods for computing finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) fields in unsteady flows. The methods approximate the particle flow map, eliminating redundant particle integrations in neighboring flow map calculations. Two classes of flow map approximations are investigated based on composition of intermediate flow maps; unidirectional approximation constructs a time-T map by composing a number of smaller time-h maps, while bidirectional approximation constructs a flow map by composing both positive- and negative-time maps. The unidirectional method is shown to be fast and accurate, although it is memory intensive. The bidirectional method is also fast and uses significantly less memory; however, it is prone to error which is large in regions where the opposite-time FTLE field is large, rendering it unusable. The algorithms are implemented and compared on three example fluid flows: a double gyre, a low Reynolds number pitching flat plate, and an unsteady ABC flow.}},
